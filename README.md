# Test project

## Seeing the output for problem 1 to 6
1. You could install a http server to view the output for first 6 problems
2. I would recommend using five server with VScode
3. With the index page, there would be a list with links to different solutions for the questions

## Seeing the output for problem 7
1. For A/B testing with next.js, you need to install node.js version > 20 and pnpm
2. Running `pnpm dev` would start the server
3. In the home page or path `/` you would be greeted with an option to go the `/home` path\
4. clicking on `/home` will take you to a page with `Welcome to first version (a) of Home page` A version or `Welcome to second version (b) of Home page` denoting B version
